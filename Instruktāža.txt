Project: Single-Player Kahoot-Like Web App
Overview

This project is a single-player quiz web application inspired by Kahoot. The goal is to allow users to create, share, and play quizzes online. Unlike Kahoot, this is designed for individual play, but users can also see quizzes created by others in a “forum” style feed.

Key Features

User Authentication

Users can register, log in, and log out.

Only registered users can create quizzes or access certain features like profile management.

Quiz Creation

Logged-in users can create quizzes with multiple questions.

Each question can have multiple choice, true/false, or text input answers.

Questions include answer options, with the ability to mark correct answers.

Quiz Forum / Listing

On the main page, users can see a list of quizzes created by other users.

Users can browse quizzes, but only logged-in users can create new quizzes.

Single-Player Quiz Play

Users can attempt quizzes and get scored based on correct answers.

Each attempt is stored so users can track past performance.

Dynamic Navbar

Displays different options depending on whether the user is logged in or not (Register/Login vs Profile/Logout).

Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS

The UI is styled with Tailwind for modern, responsive layouts.

Centralized “Create Quiz” button, clean quiz cards, and forum layout.

Database Structure

The project uses MySQL with the following main tables:

user – stores user accounts (username, email, password hash, profile picture).

quiz – stores quizzes and links them to the creator.

question – stores questions for each quiz.

answer_option – stores possible answers for questions, with correct answers marked.

quiz_attempt – stores a user’s attempt at a quiz, including score and timestamps.

user_answer – stores each answer a user gave in an attempt.
